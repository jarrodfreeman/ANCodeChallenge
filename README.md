# ANCodeChallenge

A fun little exercise/challenge for Action Network. You can view the live demo at https://jarrodcfreeman.com/demos/actionnetwork/challenge.html

## Note

- The screenshot uses FontAwesome Regular for the icons but, since a few of those aren't free to use, I went with FontAwesome Solid for consistency.
